## Perceptron Learning Algorithm

- Algorithm Explanation:
  - The Perceptron is a fundamental building block of neural networks, designed for binary classification.
  - It's inspired by the biological neuron and consists of inputs, weights, a bias term, and an activation function.
  - The algorithm learns by adjusting weights and bias based on misclassified examples.
  - The activation function is typically a step function: output 1 if weighted sum > threshold, else output 0.
- Applications:
  - Ideal for linearly separable binary classification problems.
  - Used in simple pattern recognition tasks, such as distinguishing between two classes of inputs.
  - Serves as a foundation for understanding more complex neural network architectures.
- Advantages:
  - Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement, making it excellent for educational purposes.
  - Guaranteed convergence: For linearly separable data, the algorithm is proven to converge in a finite number of steps.
  - Online learning: Can update its model with new data without retraining on the entire dataset.
  - Interpretability: Weights can be interpreted as the importance of each feature.
- Disadvantages:
  - Limited to linearly separable problems: Cannot solve XOR problem or other non-linearly separable tasks.
  - Binary classification only: Not directly applicable to multi-class problems without modifications.
  - Sensitivity to outliers: A single misclassified point can significantly affect the decision boundary.
  - No probabilistic output: Provides only hard classifications, not probability estimates.

### Pseudocode

```c
Initialize weights w = [w1, w2, ..., wn] to small random values
Initialize bias b to a small random value
Set learning rate η

While not converged:
    For each training example (x, y):
        # x is the input vector, y is the true label (-1 or 1)
        
        # Compute the weighted sum
        z = w • x + b
        
        # Apply step function
        y_pred = 1 if z > 0 else -1
        
        # Update weights and bias if misclassified
        If y_pred != y:
            w = w + η * y * x
            b = b + η * y

Return w, b
```

- Mathematical Foundations:
  - The decision boundary is defined by the equation: w • x + b = 0
  - The update rule is derived from minimizing the perceptron criterion: J(w) = -Σ y(i) * (w • x(i) + b) for misclassified points
- Historical Context:
  - Introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957
  - Initially implemented on custom hardware (the Mark I Perceptron)
  - Limitations highlighted by Minsky and Papert in 1969, leading to the first AI winter

## Adaline Learning Algorithm

- Algorithm Explanation:

  - ADALINE (Adaptive Linear Neuron) is an improvement over the Perceptron.
  - It uses a linear activation function instead of a step function.
  - The algorithm minimizes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted and actual outputs.
  - Learning occurs through gradient descent on the MSE cost function.
- Applications:
  - Suitable for binary classification problems, especially when a continuous output is desired.
  - Used in adaptive filtering and signal processing.
  - Applicable in scenarios where the strength of prediction (not just the class) is important.
- Advantages:
  - Continuous output: Provides a measure of confidence in predictions.
  - Smoother learning: Gradient-based updates allow for more nuanced weight adjustments.
  - Better convergence properties: Can converge even when data is not perfectly linearly separable.
  - Foundation for more advanced algorithms: Introduces concepts used in more complex neural networks.
- Disadvantages:
  - Still limited to linear decision boundaries: Cannot solve complex, non-linear problems.
  - Sensitive to feature scaling: Requires careful preprocessing of input features.
  - May converge slowly: Learning rate needs to be carefully tuned for optimal performance.
  - Potential for unstable learning: Large learning rates can lead to divergence.

Pseudocode:

```
Initialize weights w = [w1, w2, ..., wn] to small random values
Initialize bias b to a small random value
Set learning rate η
Set maximum number of epochs max_epochs
Set convergence threshold ε

For epoch in 1 to max_epochs:
    total_error = 0
    For each training example (x, y):
        # x is the input vector, y is the true label (-1 or 1)
        
        # Compute the weighted sum
        z = w • x + b
        
        # Compute the error
        error = y - z
        
        # Update weights and bias
        w = w + η * error * x
        b = b + η * error
        
        total_error += error^2
    
    mean_squared_error = total_error / len(training_data)
    
    If mean_squared_error < ε:
        break  # Convergence achieved

Return w, b
```

- Mathematical Foundations:
  - Cost function: J(w) = 1/2 *Σ (y(i) - (w • x(i) + b))^2
  - Gradient of cost function: ∇J(w) = -(y(i) - (w • x(i) + b))* x(i)
  - Weight update rule: w = w + η *(y(i) - (w • x(i) + b))* x(i)
- Historical Context:
  - Developed by Bernard Widrow and Ted Hoff in 1960
  - Part of the early developments in adaptive filter theory
  - Paved the way for backpropagation in multi-layer neural networks

## Supervised Learning: Linear Regression

- Algorithm Explanation:
  - Linear regression models the relationship between input features and a continuous target variable as a linear function.
  - It aims to find the best-fitting line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that minimizes the sum of squared residuals.
  - The model is defined by y = w0 + w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ... + wn*xn, where w are the weights and x are the features.
- Applications:
  - Predicting continuous outcomes based on input features (e.g., house prices, stock prices, sales forecasts).
  - Analyzing the relationship between variables in various fields (economics, biology, social sciences).
  - Serve as a baseline model for more complex regression tasks.
- Advantages:
  - Simplicity and interpretability: Easy to understand and explain to non-technical stakeholders.
  - Computational efficiency: Fast to train and make predictions, especially for small to medium-sized datasets.
  - Statistical inference: Provides insights into the significance and impact of individual features.
  - Works well for linear relationships: Optimal when the relationship between features and target is approximately linear.
- Disadvantages:
  - Assumes linearity: May perform poorly when the true relationship is non-linear.
  - Sensitive to outliers: Extreme values can significantly impact the model's coefficients.
  - Limited expressiveness: Cannot capture complex patterns in the data.
  - Assumes independence of errors: May be inappropriate when errors are correlated (e.g., time series data).
- Pseudocode (using Ordinary Least Squares):

     ```
     # X is the feature matrix (m x n), y is the target vector (m x 1)
     # m is the number of samples, n is the number of features
     
     # Add a column of ones to X for the bias term
     X = [ones(m, 1), X]
     
     # Compute the weights using the normal equation
     w = (X^T * X)^(-1) * X^T * y
     
     # w[0] is the bias term, w[1:] are the feature weights
     
     # Make predictions
     def predict(x):
         return w[0] + w[1:] • x
     
     Return w, predict
     ```

- Mathematical Foundations:
  - Cost function (Mean Squared Error): J(w) = 1/m *Σ (y(i) - (w • x(i)))^2
  - Normal equation: w = (X^T *X)^(-1)* X^T* y
  - R-squared (coefficient of determination): R^2 = 1 - (SSres / SStot)
- Extensions and Variants:
  - Weighted linear regression: Assigns different importance to different samples.
  - Ridge regression: Adds L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
  - Lasso regression: Uses L1 regularization for feature selection.
- Assumptions and Diagnostics:
  - Linearity: Residual plots should show no pattern.
  - Independence: Residuals should be uncorrelated.
  - Homoscedasticity: Variance of residuals should be constant.
  - Normality: Residuals should be normally distributed.

## Supervised Learning: Polynomial Regression

- Algorithm Explanation:
  - Polynomial regression extends linear regression by modeling the relationship between features and target as an nth degree polynomial.
  - It transforms the original features by adding polynomial terms, then applies linear regression on these expanded features.
  - The model takes the form: y = w0 + w1*x + w2*x^2 + ... + wn*x^n for a single feature, or more complex forms for multiple features.
- Applications:
  - Modeling non-linear relationships in data where the pattern follows a polynomial curve.
  - Capturing more complex patterns in scientific and engineering data.
  - Describing growth curves, physical processes, or economic trends that exhibit non-linear behavior.
- Advantages:
  - Flexibility: Can model a wide range of non-linear relationships.
  - Interpretability: Still relatively easy to understand compared to more complex non-linear models.
  - Smooth predictions: Provides continuous and smooth predictions over the input space.
  - Feature engineering: Introduces the concept of creating new features from existing ones.
- Disadvantages:
  - Overfitting risk: Higher degree polynomials can easily overfit the training data.
  - Sensitive to outliers: Especially problematic with high-degree polynomials.
  - Extrapolation issues: May perform poorly when predicting outside the range of training data.
  - Curse of dimensionality: The number of features grows rapidly with the polynomial degree and number of original features.
- Pseudocode:

     ```
     # X is the original feature matrix, y is the target vector
     # degree is the highest polynomial degree to use
     
     def generate_polynomial_features(X, degree):
         X_poly = X.copy()
         for d in range(2, degree + 1):
             X_poly = hstack([X_poly, X^d])
         return X_poly
     
     # Generate polynomial features
     X_poly = generate_polynomial_features(X, degree)
     
     # Add a column of ones for the bias term
     X_poly = [ones(m, 1), X_poly]
     
     # Compute weights using the normal equation (as in linear regression)
     w = (X_poly^T * X_poly)^(-1) * X_poly^T * y
     
     # Make predictions
     def predict(x):
         x_poly = generate_polynomial_features(x, degree)
         return w[0] + w[1:] • x_poly
     
     Return w, predict
     ```

- Mathematical Foundations:
  - Basis expansion: φ(x) = [1, x, x^2, ..., x^n]
  - Model: y = w • φ(x)

  - Regularization techniques (Ridge, Lasso) to prevent overfitting
- Multivariate Polynomial Regression:
  - Includes interaction terms between features
  - Exponential growth in number of features: careful feature selection is crucial
- Considerations:
  - Feature scaling becomes critical due to large differences in magnitude of polynomial terms
  - Interpretability decreases with higher degree polynomials
  - Visualization is helpful for understanding the fitted curve (up to 2-3 dimensions)

## Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression

- Algorithm Explanation:
  - Logistic regression is a classification algorithm that estimates the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.
  - It applies the logistic function (sigmoid) to a linear combination of features to output a probability between 0 and 1.
  - The decision boundary is the point where the predicted probability equals 0.5.
  - Despite its name, logistic regression is used for classification, not regression.
- Applications:

  - Interpretability: Coefficients can be interpreted as log-odds.
  - Efficient training: Typically converges quickly for linearly separable data.
  - Handles outliers better than linear regression for classification tasks.
- Disadvantages:
  - Assumes linearity: May underperform with highly non-linear decision boundaries.
  - Limited to linear decision boundaries: Cannot capture complex relationships without feature engineering.
  - Prone to underfit: May have high bias when dealing with complex datasets.
  - Requires more data: Needs more samples per parameter compared to linear regression.

     def sigmoid(z):
         return 1 / (1 + e^(-z))
     
     For iteration in 1 to num_iterations:
         For each training example (x, y):
             # Forward pass
             z = w • x + b
             y_pred = sigmoid(z)
             
             # Compute gradients
             dw = (y_pred - y) * x
             db = y_pred - y
             
             # Update parameters
             w = w - α * dw
             b = b - α * db
     
     def predict_prob(x):
         return sigmoid(w • x + b)
     
     def predict_class(x):
         return 1 if predict_prob(x) > 0.5 else 0
